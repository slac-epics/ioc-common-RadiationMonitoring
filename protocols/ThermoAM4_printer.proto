# ThermoAMS4 Printer Protocol
# 
# This protocol file is specific for the printer serial port
# on the AM4 air beta radiation monitoring instrument. 
#
# Reads in the formatted string from the printer output of the AMS-4
#  Example string format below:
#
#  04/27/18 02:39:42
#  0.0021 Bq/CM3
#  0.0 CM3
#  NO STATUS CHANGE
# 
#  In a single line, this looks like:
#
#  \r\n  04/27/18 02:39:42\r\n  0.0021 Bq/CM3\r\n  0.0 CM3\r\n  NO STATUS CHANGE\r\n  \r\n
